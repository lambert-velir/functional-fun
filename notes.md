## Maybe

- We are more than merely informed about a Nothing, we are forced to map to get to the value
- imperative equivalents
  - if (x !== null) { return f(x); }
- allows linear flow despite logical branching
- Maybe is baked into some languages, swift, scala
  - Sometimes called Optional, Some/None
- "We can also visualize the mapping of a morphism and its corresponding objects with this diagram:" https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/ch08.html#a-spot-of-theory
